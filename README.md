# starter-wp

A highly opinionated starter framework for WordPress.

Leverages [Kaiso](https://github.com/TomodomoCo/kaiso) and [Timber](https://github.com/timber/timber) for a more modern, concern-separated approach to WordPress development. Installs [psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm) and [phpcs](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) for linting and static analysis. Uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) as a front-end build system.

## Usage

Vagrant setup:

1. `git clone [repo]`
2. `cp -r app/secrets-example app/secrets`
3. Fill out files in `app/secrets/`
4. `vagrant up`

Building the project:

1. `composer install`
2. `nvm install && nvm use`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev` or `npm run build`

Linting:

+ `npm run lint-php` for both `phpcs` and `psalm`
+ `npm run phpcs` or `./vendor/composer/bin/phpcs`
+ `npm run psalm` or `./vendor/composer/bin/psalm`

Building plugin dependencies (e.g. for Gutenberg blocks):

1. `npm run lerna-install`
2. `npm run lerna-dev` or `npm run lerna-build`
